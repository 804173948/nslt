# Neural Sign Language Translation

This repo containts the training and evalution code of Sign2Text setup for translation sign langauge videos to spoken language sentences. 

This code is based on [an earlier version of Luong et al.'s Neural Machine Translation Tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt/tree/tf-1.2). 

## Requirements
* Download and extract [RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014 T: Parallel Corpus of Sign Language Video, Gloss and Translation](https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~koller/RWTH-PHOENIX-2014-T/)
* Download and install Tensorflow 1.3.0+
